Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: A line must be added to your /etc/sudoers file.  Do this automatically?
 To allow a user to enable and disable the mastershaper rules from the web UI, the www-data user must be able to execute the shell command required to do so.  
 To enable this, the following line must be added to /etc/sudoers: 
 "www-data      ALL= NOPASSWD: /var/www/mastershaper/shaper_loader.sh"  
 If you choose to make this change manually,  you will also have to remove the line manually if you choose to remove mastershaper.
